# Timeline Take-Home Assignment

## Considerations

**What you like about your implementation.**

I like that my implementation is simple, objetive and user friendly.

**What you would change if you were going to do it again.**

- I'd improve the timeline board structure to present the whole time period in columns; this would allow me to remove the "Date period" from the items, thus making it more intuitive OR I'd format the date period in a more pleasant way.
- I'd also refactor part of the `assignLanes` function; I edited the script to add the days count of each period and the days period from the start date of each lane. These updates made the script a bit long, and I believe this could be improved and better organized.

**How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.**

I did Googled a few timeline examples. But the main reference was the Jira timeline.

**How you would test this if you had more time.**

- I believe I'd test the date period calculations, days count and date differences;
- Also the validation of the date periods, for example, to make sure the end date is after the start;
- Rendering/positioning tests, to verify that the lanes/itens are position correctly.
